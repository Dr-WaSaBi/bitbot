# Using BitBot - For the end user

This will be a quick little guild to help people use BitBot better

## Easy way (kind of) to learn BitBot
If you want to play around with BitBot, but not bug others.  Create your own private channel, and invite **BitBot** to your channel.  This way, you and **BitBot** have a nice safe place to learn and explore 

### Create channel instructions
Put a list here on how to create a private channel, invite **BitBot**, and start learning.

## What can BitBot do for you?

Need a list of all the ways a user can interact with **BitBot**
  
### Location
How to set your location.  Once your location is set, you can other irc users can do see where you are from.  See what your weather is like.  To set your location use the following command.

```
,config u location [name of your city], [State/Providence], [Country]
```
And yes.  I did mean to start that line with a comma. 

Also, if you want too you can see where others are from by using

```
,l [otherusersnick]
```

### Weather
Once BitBot knows your location, it can tell you the weather.  It can also tell you the weather or other users in the channel.

### Time
This command will show you what time it is for a person in the channel

### Birthday
